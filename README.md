# üì¶ ng-route-logger

**ng-route-logger** is a simple and powerful Angular library that helps you **track page navigation times** inside your Angular application.

Whenever a user switches from one route (page) to another, this library records:
- üìç The new page‚Äôs URL (like `/home`, `/about`)
- ‚è±Ô∏è How many milliseconds it took to load that page

This is super useful if you're building a fast Angular app and want to know which routes take longer to load.

## üéØ Why Should You Use It?

‚úÖ Simple to set up  
‚úÖ Works with Angular's built-in router  
‚úÖ Uses **RxJS Observables**, so you can subscribe to live logs  
‚úÖ Helpful for developers, testers, and learners

## üì¶ Installation

Run this command in your Angular project folder:

```bash
npm install ng-route-logger
```
## üß∞ Having Trouble Installing?

If you're facing issues while installing (like cache or permission problems), you can force the install using:

```bash
npm install ng-route-logger --force
```
## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

### 1. Import the Module

In your `app.module.ts`, import the logger module:

```ts
import { NgRouteLoggerModule } from 'ng-route-logger';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    NgRouteLoggerModule,  // Add this line
    ...
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```
### 2. Use the Logger Service

You can inject the logger service into any component or service like this:

```ts
import { NgRouteLoggerService } from 'ng-route-logger';

constructor(private logger: NgRouteLoggerService) {
  this.logger.getLogs()
}
```
## üìö Example Log Output

```ts
[
  { route: '/home', loadTime: 96.3 },
  { route: '/about', loadTime: 201.7 },
  { route: '/contact', loadTime: 87.2 }
]
```
## üìö Example Use Cases
- Show a "page load time" chart for users

- Find out which pages take longest to load

- Log page transitions for debugging or performance testing


## üîç What‚Äôs Happening in the Background?

- ‚è±Ô∏è Starts timer when route navigation begins (`NavigationStart`)
- üõë Stops timer when navigation ends (`NavigationEnd`)
- üßæ Logs the route and time taken
- üì° Streams the logs using **RxJS Observable**
